# Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies phenomena at atomic and subatomic scales. It provides a mathematical framework to describe the behavior of particles like electrons, photons, and atoms, fundamentally governed by probability.

## Foundational Principles

- **Wave-Particle Duality**
  Particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, depending on how they are observed.

- **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**
  It is impossible to simultaneously determine both the exact position $x$ and momentum $p$ of a particle:
  $$
  \Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
  $$
  where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.

- **Quantum Superposition**
  A particle can exist in a combination of states simultaneously until measured. For example, an electron in a quantum system can occupy multiple energy states.

### Schrödinger's Equation

The time-dependent Schrödinger equation describes how the quantum state of a system evolves over time:
$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, t) = \hat{H} \Psi(x, t)
$$
Here:
- $\Psi(x, t)$ is the wave function, representing the probability amplitude.
- $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, representing the total energy of the system. [!h3]

## Quantum States

- **Wave Function**
  The wave function $\Psi(x)$ encodes the probability distribution of a particle's position and momentum. The square of its magnitude, $|\Psi(x)|^2$, represents the probability density.

- **Operators in Quantum Mechanics**
  Physical quantities like position and momentum are represented by operators. For instance:
  - Position: $\hat{x} = x$
  - Momentum: $\hat{p} = -i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}$

### Measurement and Collapse

Measurement in quantum mechanics collapses the wave function into a single state, breaking the superposition. This phenomenon is described by the Copenhagen interpretation. [!h3]

## Applications of Quantum Mechanics

- **Quantum Computing**
  Uses principles like superposition and entanglement to perform computations exponentially faster than classical computers for specific tasks.

- **Quantum Cryptography**
  Provides secure communication protocols by leveraging the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, such as the no-cloning theorem.

### Advanced Applications

- **Quantum Field Theory (QFT)**
  Extends quantum mechanics to fields, describing particle interactions via exchange particles (e.g., photons in electromagnetism).

- **Applications in Material Science**
  Quantum mechanics is crucial in understanding semiconductors, superconductors, and novel materials like graphene. [!h3]
